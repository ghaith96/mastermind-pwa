# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a digital version of the classic Mastermind board game using Svelte, optimized as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with mobile-first design and touch interactions. The game allows players to guess a secret color combination through logical deduction, providing an engaging puzzle experience on mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to play Mastermind on my phone with touch controls, so that I can enjoy the game anywhere with intuitive interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL be optimized for touch interactions with appropriately sized buttons and controls
2. WHEN the user taps on color pegs THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and allow easy selection
3. WHEN the user performs touch gestures THEN the system SHALL respond smoothly without lag or unintended actions
4. WHEN the user rotates their device THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately to maintain usability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to make guesses by selecting color combinations, so that I can attempt to crack the secret code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player starts a new game THEN the system SHALL generate a random secret code of 4 colors from a set of 6-8 available colors
2. WHEN the player selects colors for their guess THEN the system SHALL allow them to choose from the available color palette
3. WHEN the player completes a guess row THEN the system SHALL validate that all 4 positions are filled before allowing submission
4. WHEN the player submits a valid guess THEN the system SHALL move to the next guess row automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive feedback on my guesses, so that I can use logical deduction to solve the puzzle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player submits a guess THEN the system SHALL provide feedback using black and white pegs
2. WHEN a guessed color is correct and in the right position THEN the system SHALL display a black peg
3. WHEN a guessed color is correct but in the wrong position THEN the system SHALL display a white peg
4. WHEN a guessed color is not in the secret code THEN the system SHALL provide no peg for that position
5. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL not reveal which specific positions the feedback refers to

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear win/lose conditions, so that I know when the game is complete and can start a new game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player guesses the exact secret code THEN the system SHALL display a victory message and reveal the secret code
2. WHEN the player uses all available guesses without solving the code THEN the system SHALL display a game over message and reveal the secret code
3. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL provide an option to start a new game
4. WHEN the player starts a new game THEN the system SHALL reset all guesses and generate a new secret code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to work offline and install like a native app, so that I can play without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the app THEN the system SHALL be installable as a PWA on their device
2. WHEN the user has no internet connection THEN the system SHALL still function fully for gameplay
3. WHEN the user installs the PWA THEN the system SHALL provide an app-like experience with proper icons and splash screens
4. WHEN the app updates THEN the system SHALL cache new versions and notify users of updates appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface, so that the game is enjoyable and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the game THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN the user views the game board THEN the system SHALL show previous guesses, feedback, and the current guess row clearly
3. WHEN the user interacts with game elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual states (hover, active, disabled)
4. WHEN the user needs to understand game rules THEN the system SHALL provide accessible help or instructions
5. WHEN the game displays colors THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast and accessibility for color-blind users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to customize my game experience, so that I can adjust difficulty and preferences to my liking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks the settings icon THEN the system SHALL display a slide-out settings panel directly in the main game interface
2. WHEN the player accesses game settings THEN the system SHALL allow selection of difficulty levels (number of colors available)
3. WHEN the player changes difficulty THEN the system SHALL adjust the color palette accordingly (6, 7, or 8 colors)
4. WHEN the player starts a game THEN the system SHALL use the selected difficulty settings
5. WHEN the player changes any setting THEN the system SHALL immediately apply and persist the change without requiring explicit save action
6. WHEN the player selects a color theme THEN the system SHALL apply the selected color palette to the game
7. WHEN the player changes the color theme THEN the system SHALL persist this preference for future sessions
8. WHEN the player starts a new game THEN the system SHALL use the selected color theme
9. WHEN a setting is successfully changed THEN the system SHALL display a brief confirmation message
10. WHEN the player clicks outside the settings panel or clicks the close button THEN the system SHALL hide the settings panel

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the game to support both light and dark themes, so that I can play comfortably in different lighting conditions and according to my visual preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and apply the user's system theme preference (light or dark)
2. WHEN the user's system theme preference changes THEN the app SHALL automatically update its theme accordingly
3. WHEN the user manually selects a theme in the settings THEN the system SHALL override the system preference and apply the selected theme
4. WHEN the user changes the theme THEN the system SHALL persist this preference for future sessions
5. WHEN the dark theme is active THEN the system SHALL ensure all UI elements maintain proper contrast and readability
6. WHEN the user switches between themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not disrupt the current game state
